# Versioning and changelog

The changelog is prepared before a release, by moving changelog entries from `UNRELEASED.md` to `CHANGELOG.md`, under a new heading for the version number.

### How to write a changelog entry:

-   Use sentence case and plain language
-   Use imperative mood vs past tense (i.e. "Add thing to Button", "Deprecate thing on Card")
-   Avoid redundancy when possible (try to phrase a bug fix entry without the word “bug”)

Entries should follow this structure, making sure to link the relevant PR:

```md
-   Verb + brief description of change in `ComponentName` ([#1](https://github.com/FieldLevel/FieldLevelPlaybook/pull/1))
```

## Out of scope for `CHANGELOG.md`

Generally, changes related to these topics can be omitted:

-   Dev dependency upgrades
-   Changes to "private" components or utilities that aren't exported
-   Chores (build tooling, release process)

## Unreleased changes

Unreleased changes should be placed in the `UNRELEASED.md` file before a PR is merged.
Entries should be moved from `UNRELEASED.md` to `CHANGELOG.md` as a part of the release process.

## Versioning scheme

The following sections detail what kinds of changes result in each of major, minor, and patch version bumps:

### Major

-   Removal of a component
-   Removal of a prop from a component
-   Change to the type accepted for a prop
-   Breaking changes to minimum version of dependencies
-   Breaking changes to tailwind preset configuration

### Minor

-   New component
-   New prop for a component
-   Additional type accepted for a prop
-   Deprecation of a component, prop, or tailwind utility (ahead of its removal in the next major version)

### Patch

-   Breaking change to the HTML generated by a component, including addition, removal, or renaming of classes
-   Changes that do not impact public APIs
-   Non-breaking changes to minimum version of dependencies

### Pre-release

-   Sometimes a deployed project (i.e. a QA branch) needs to be able to install a pre-release version of Playbook in which case it must be deployed to the Azure Artifacts registry.
-   Signify a pre-release version by appending a `-#` to the upcoming release version (ex: `1.0.0-1`)
