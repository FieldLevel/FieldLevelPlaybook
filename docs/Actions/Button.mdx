# Button

Buttons are identifiable, findable, and clear. They initiate actions or events using language that lets users know what will happen next.

<Controls of={stories.Default} />

## Basic

Basic should be the most commonly used button in the interface. It is our medium-emphasis button. If the action requires more or less emphasis or is a destructive action, use another style.

## Primary

Use to highlight the most critical action on the page. Don't use more than one primary button in a section or screen to avoid overloading customers with high emphasis calls-to-action.

<Canvas of={stories.Primary} />

## Secondary

Use as the secondary action when paired with a primary or destructive action. Cancel is the most common example here.

<Canvas of={stories.Secondary} />

## Plain

Use for less important actions or low-emphasis situations. Plain is commonly paired with basic as a secondary CTA.

## Destructive

Use for actions that could have a destructive effect on customer data, such as delete or remove.

## Icon

Use to call attention to a button. Provide a label in most cases. There are few instances where an icon can operate on its own.

## Size

Buttons come in three sizes: base, large, and slim. Use base for most usages.

## Disabled

Use when an action is unavailable, or another process must be completed before the button is usable.

<Canvas of={stories.Disabled} />

## Full Width

Use when you need a button to expand to the full width of it's parent container.

<Canvas of={stories.FullWidth} />

## Url

You can pass `url` and/or `target` props to any Button to make sure it's semantically wrapped in a link if the action is a navigation change.

<Canvas of={stories.Url} />

## Accessibility

Use the `ariaLabel` or `ariaLabelledBy` props to provide accessible button labels for any Button without a label.

<Canvas of={stories.Accessibility} />

## Submit

Use the submit option for the Button inside a Form that should trigger the form submit action when clicked.

<Canvas of={stories.Submit} />

## Ref

You can get access to the ref of the inner button element by utilizing the `ref` prop.
