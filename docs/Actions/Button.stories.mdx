# Button

Buttons are identifiable, findable, and clear. They initiate actions or events using language that lets users know what will happen next.

<Canvas>
    <Story story={stories.Default} name="Default" />
</Canvas>

<ArgsTable story="Default" />

## Basic

Basic should be the most commonly used button in the interface. It is our medium-emphasis button. If the action requires more or less emphasis or is a destructive action, use another style.

<Canvas>
    <Story story={stories.Basic} />
</Canvas>

## Primary

Use to highlight the most critical action on the page. Don't use more than one primary button in a section or screen to avoid overloading customers with high emphasis calls-to-action.

<Canvas>
    <Story story={stories.Primary} />
</Canvas>

## Secondary

Use as the secondary action when paired with a primary or destructive action. Cancel is the most common example here.

<Canvas>
    <Story story={stories.Secondary} />
</Canvas>

## Plain

Use for less important actions or low-emphasis situations. Plain is commonly paired with basic as a secondary CTA.

<Canvas>
    <Story story={stories.Plain} />
</Canvas>

## Destructive

Use for actions that could have a destructive effect on customer data, such as delete or remove.

<Canvas>
    <Story story={stories.Destructive} />
</Canvas>

## Icon

Use to call attention to a button. Provide a label in most cases. There are few instances where an icon can operate on its own.

<Canvas>
    <Story story={stories.Icon} />
</Canvas>

## Size

Buttons come in three sizes: base, large, and slim. Use base for most usages.

<Canvas>
    <Story story={stories.Size} />
</Canvas>

## Disabled

Use when an action is unavailable, or another process must be completed before the button is usable.

<Canvas>
    <Story story={stories.Disabled} />
</Canvas>

## Full Width

Use when you need a button to expand to the full width of it's parent container.

<Canvas>
    <Story story={stories.FullWidth} />
</Canvas>

## Submit

Use the submit option for the Button inside a Form that should trigger the form submit action when clicked.

<Canvas>
    <Story story={stories.Submit} />
</Canvas>
