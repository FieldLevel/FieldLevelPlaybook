# Logo

A logo is a visual representation of a program or team.

<Canvas>
    <Story story={stories.Default} name="Default" />
</Canvas>

<ArgsTable story="Default" />

## Size

<Canvas>
    <Story story={stories.Size} />
</Canvas>

## Lazy

Use when the browser should wait to load the image contents until the image will be visible in the viewport. Good practice when there are many images on a page like in a long list that extends out of the initial viewport.

<Canvas>
    <Story story={stories.Lazy} />
</Canvas>
