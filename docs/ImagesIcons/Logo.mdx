# Logo

A logo is a visual representation of a program or team.

<Canvas of={stories.Default} />

<ArgTypes of={stories.default.component} />

## Size

<Canvas of={stories.Size} />

## Lazy

Use when the browser should wait to load the image contents until the image will be visible in the viewport. Good practice when there are many images on a page like in a long list that extends out of the initial viewport.

<Canvas of={stories.Lazy} />
