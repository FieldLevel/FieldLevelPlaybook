# Modal

Modals focus the user's attention exclusively on one task by displaying content in a layer above the page. They can be disruptive and should be used thoughtfully and sparingly.

<Canvas>
    <Story story={stories.Default} name="Default" />
</Canvas>

<ArgsTable story="Default" />

## No Title

The Modal title is optional to allow arbitrary content to be placed in any Modal.

<Canvas>
    <Story story={stories.NoTitle} />
</Canvas>

## With Actions

Use the `primaryAction` or `secondaryAction` prop to add the appropriate Buttons to a Modal footer.

<Canvas>
    <Story story={stories.WithActions} />
</Canvas>

## With Disabled Action

Either action can be disabled by using the `disabled` flag to the appropriate action.

<Canvas>
    <Story story={stories.WithDisabledAction} />
</Canvas>

## With Destructive Action

The primary action be made destructive by using the `destructive` flag.

<Canvas>
    <Story story={stories.WithDestructiveAction} />
</Canvas>

## Scrollable Body

Modal has a max height by design so if the content in the modal body overflows, the body will scroll.

<Canvas>
    <Story story={stories.Scrollable} />
</Canvas>

## Small

Use a small modal when less horizontal space makes the content more readable.

<Canvas>
    <Story story={stories.Small} />
</Canvas>

## Large

Use a large modal when more horizontal space makes the content more readable.

<Canvas>
    <Story story={stories.Large} />
</Canvas>
