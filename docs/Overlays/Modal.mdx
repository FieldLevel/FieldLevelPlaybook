# Modal

Modals focus the user's attention exclusively on one task by displaying content in a layer above the page. They can be disruptive and should be used thoughtfully and sparingly.

<Canvas of={stories.Default} />

<ArgTypes of={stories.default.component} />

## No Title

The Modal title is optional to allow arbitrary content to be placed in any Modal.

<Canvas of={stories.NoTitle} />

## With Actions

Use the `primaryAction` or `secondaryAction` prop to add the appropriate Buttons to a Modal footer.

<Canvas of={stories.WithActions} />

## With Disabled Action

Either action can be disabled by using the `disabled` flag to the appropriate action.

<Canvas of={stories.WithDisabledAction} />

## With Destructive Action

The primary action be made destructive by using the `destructive` flag.

<Canvas of={stories.WithDestructiveAction} />

## With Tertiary Action

A third button can be added using the `tertiaryAction` prop.

<Canvas of={stories.WithTertiaryAction} />

## Scrollable Body

Modal has a max height by design so if the content in the modal body overflows, the body will scroll.

<Canvas of={stories.Scrollable} />

## Small

Use a small modal when less horizontal space makes the content more readable.

<Canvas of={stories.Small} />

## Large

Use a large modal when more horizontal space makes the content more readable.

<Canvas of={stories.Large} />

## Persistent

Use a persistent modal when you want to prevent the user from accidentally dismissing the modal with a background
interaction and be sure to provide an explicit interaction to dismiss.
