# FieldLevel Playbook

Playbook is FieldLevel's product language. **A shared vocabulary and system for design that enables developers and designers
to build better faster.**

Playbook balances constraints and flexibility making it efficient to deliver a consistent product experience by providing standard components. Playbook enables product teams to move quickly while building consistently exceptional experiences.

## Components

Common presentional patterns are encapsulated into a collection of React components with distinct opinionated variations and
clear usage guidance. The majority of product experiences should be built using these components and any changes to components
should be made in a thoughtful and collaborative manner. Overriding or extending the style of Playbook components should be done
only when absolutely necessary since it makes it difficult to anticipate the impact of changes in the future and makes the system
harder to reason about.

See the [Component status](/docs/status--docs) page for a list of existing and planned components.

```
import { Card, Button } from @fieldlevel/playbook;

const HelloCard = () => (
    <Card title="Hello world!">
        <Button>Hi Playbook!</Button>
    </Card>
);
```

## Tailwind Utility Classes

When you need more flexibility to build one-off experiences or have a desired product experience that can't be solved with existing
components, you can style components using the same Tailwind utility classes that were used to build Playbook. There are two ways to
use the Tailwind utility classes:

**Via @apply directive in a CSS file.** Use this method to give an element a semantic class name and to make component behavior that
impacts visual style easier to read and reason about. All Playbook components are built with this method.

```
.StrongText {
    @apply text-base font-bold;
}
```

**By class names on an element.** Use this method while initially prototyping component styles or when semantically naming
an element would be overkill. Use sparingly since a long concatenation of classes in markup can be more difficult to read
and the semantic intention of the element can be lost when revisiting in the future.

```
<div className="text-base font-bold">Example</div>
```

Most of the default Tailwind CSS utility classes are available to be used as the [official documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs)
describes. Our custom Tailwind configuration has the following exceptions:

-   **[Breakpoints](/docs/css-utilities-breakpoints--docs)**: Breakpoint widths have been modified to match what is already being
    used in the FieldLevel app.

-   **[Colors](/docs/css-utilities-colors--docs)**: **Text color**, **background color** and **border color** utilities draw from
    a limited color palette and are named for semantic usage rather than color shade.

-   **[Text](/docs/css-utilities-text--docs)**: Only a limited set of text **size** and **weight** is available and
    utilities to modify **line-height**, **text opacity** and **font family** have been disabled.
