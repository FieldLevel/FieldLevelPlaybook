# ChoiceGroup

Use to create a list of radio buttons or checkboxes.Â Use a Choice Group when you want to emphasize options, when you have less than five options, when the comparison of options needs to be clear, and when a quick response is a priority. Choice Groups are generally easier to use in a mobile-first experience, choose the list when usage is unclear.
