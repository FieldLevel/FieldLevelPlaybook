# Select

Select gives users the ability to make a single selection or multiple choices from several options. Use Select when you have four or more options to avoid noisy lists in the app, when the default option is the recommended option, when a large number of familiar options are available (CA, AZ, NV, OR and etc.), and when you have more than seven options.
