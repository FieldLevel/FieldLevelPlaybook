# FieldLevel Playbook

Playbook is FieldLevel's product language. **A shared vocabulary and system for design that enables developers and designers
to build better faster.**

Playbook attempts to strike a balance between constraints and flexibility to make it efficient to deliver a consistent product
experience for all FieldLevel users. It does so by providing a set of common presentional components built on top of a custom
configuration of [Tailwind CSS](https://www.tailwindcss.com). Product teams are able to use components to move quickly when building
new user experiences, but also have access to the same low level utility classes that Playbook was built with when more customization
is required.

## Components

React components. Variations with clear guidance. [Component status](/?path=/story/status--page)

```
import { Card, Button } from @fieldlevel/playbook;

const HelloCard = () => (
    <Card title="Hello world!">
        <Button>Hi Playbook!</Button>
    </Card>
);
```

## Tailwind Utility Classes

There are two ways to use the Tailwind utility classes.

**By class names on an element.** Use this method while initially prototyping component styles or when semantically naming
an element would be overkill. Use sparingly since a long concatenation of classes in markup can be more difficult to read
and the semantic intention of the element can be lost when revisiting in the future.

```
<div className="text-base font-bold">Example</div>
```

**Via @apply directive in a CSS file.** Use this method to. All Playbook components are built

```
.StrongText {
    @apply text-base font-bold;
}
```
