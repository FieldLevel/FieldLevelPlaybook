# Breakpoints

Breakpoint utilities are avaiable for responsive styling. Most Playbook components are designed to only provide a variation at the `lg`
breakpoint (so only mobile and desktop versions), but additional breakpoints are available in case they are needed in product experiences
and for backwards compatibility in existing app designs.
